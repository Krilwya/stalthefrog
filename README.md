# Stal Frog Rebrand Page

Simple one-page site for GitHub Pages.

## Use your image

Place your Stal image at `assets/stal.png`.

If the image is missing, the page shows a styled fallback block automatically.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Push these files to a GitHub repository.
2. In repository settings, open **Pages**.
3. Set source to your main branch and root folder.
4. Save, then open your published URL.

The signature count uses CountAPI directly from the browser.
